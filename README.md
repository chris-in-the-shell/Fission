# Fission

Fission is a product initiative by **Arkenstone Labs**.

This repository is maintained under a personal account as a pre-organization incubation workspace to:
- design the product architecture,
- validate key assumptions,
- and prototype selected features before full organizational execution.

The intent is to transfer and scale this work into formal Arkenstone Labs workflows after initial validation.

## Current Scope

- Detailed product planning (`PRODUCT_PLAN.md`)
- Early implementation design for a Teleoplexy-oriented prediction market protocol
- Integration blueprint for prior governance tooling patterns

## Origin Context

Part of the planning references lessons from prior governance tooling developed during the IterateFast Labs era, especially:
- <https://github.com/IterateFast-Labs/OP_multi_agent_framework>

Those patterns are being adapted into Fission as decision-intelligence and governance automation components.
